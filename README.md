## Dynamic Array

A **dynamic array** is a data structure that allows you to store elements in a contiguous block of memory which can be resized during runtime. Unlike static arrays with fixed sizes, dynamic arrays can adjust their capacity as elements are added or removed. This section includes:

- **Dynamic Memory Allocation:**  
  How memory is allocated, resized, and deallocated using operators such as `new[]` and `delete[]`.

- **Core Methods:**  
  Implementation details of methods like `push_back`, `pop_back`, `insert`, and `erase`.

- **Performance Considerations:**  
  Discussion on the efficiency of resizing on every operation versus using exponential growth strategies.

---

## Linked List

A **linked list** is a sequence of nodes where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node (and possibly the previous node in a doubly linked list). This section covers:

- **Node Structure:**  
  Definition of the node and how pointers are used to link nodes together.

- **Types of Linked Lists:**  
  Singly linked lists versus doubly linked lists, with their respective advantages and trade-offs.

- **Operations:**  
  Insertion, deletion, and traversal of nodes, along with an explanation of how these operations affect performance compared to arrays.

---

## Stack

A **stack** is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. This section focuses on:

- **Implementation Approaches:**  
  How stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists.

- **Fundamental Operations:**  
  Methods such as `push` (to add an element), `pop` (to remove the top element), and `peek` (to access the top element without removing it).

- **Use Cases:**  
  Practical examples of stack usage in algorithm design and real-world applications (e.g., function call management, undo mechanisms).

---

## Queue

A **queue** is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. Here, we discuss:

- **Queue Implementations:**  
  Building queues using arrays or linked lists.

- **Core Operations:**  
  Key functions such as `enqueue` (to add an element), `dequeue` (to remove an element), and `front` (to access the first element).

- **Applications:**  
  Scenarios where queues are used, including scheduling, buffering, and task management.

## Hash Table

A **hash table** stores key-value pairs for efficient lookup operations using a hash function. This section explains:

- **Hash Functions:**  
  How hash functions work and methods for designing them.

- **Collision Resolution:**  
  Techniques such as chaining and open addressing to handle collisions.

- **Implementation Details:**  
  Strategies for building hash tables in C++ and performance analysis in terms of average and worst-case complexities.

- **Real-World Uses:**  
  Applications in databases, caching systems, and indexing.

---

## Trees

**Trees** are hierarchical data structures that represent data in a tree-like model. In this section, you will learn about:

- **Binary Trees & Binary Search Trees (BST):**  
  Their structure, how they store data, and methods for traversal (in-order, pre-order, and post-order).

- **Balanced Trees:**  
  An overview of AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, and why balancing is important for maintaining efficient operations.

- **Use Cases:**  
  How trees are used in sorting, searching, and organizing data in many computer science applications.

---

## Graphs

**Graphs** are advanced data structures used to model relationships between objects. This section includes:

- **Graph Representations:**  
  Different ways to represent graphs, such as adjacency lists and adjacency matrices.

- **Graph Traversal Algorithms:**  
  Implementation and explanation of traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

- **Advanced Algorithms:**  
  Discussions on algorithms for finding the shortest path, minimum spanning trees, and network flows.

- **Applications:**  
  Practical applications of graphs in networking, pathfinding, social networks, and more.
